# Portfolio website react

My portfolio website is created with react. The most I learned was working with components, packages, useState, props, slots, and a lot more. the styling was done with some bootstrap but mostly with plane CSS and I was focusing on using Bam as a way of writing class names. This is to show that I have a basic understanding of front end development.
